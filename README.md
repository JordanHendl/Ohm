A GPU library like others ive made, but I watched a lot of cppcon talks so i wanted to remake some stuff.

This project's external dependancies are:

--Google's benchmark library: https://github.com/google/benchmark

--Google's shaderc: https://github.com/google/shaderc

--GTest: https://github.com/google/googletest

--Khronos Group's SPIRV-Reflect: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Reflect
